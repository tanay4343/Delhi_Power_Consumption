AI-Based Load Forecasting and Optimization for NCT of Delhi
The National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi faces significant challenges in managing its highly variable power demand, influenced by factors such as seasonal fluctuations, time-of-day variations, and rapid urban development. To address these issues, we propose an AI-based load forecasting and optimization model aimed at enhancing accuracy in power demand forecasting and optimizing power procurement strategies.

Solution Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to create an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven model that predicts power demand based on a comprehensive dataset. The solution includes:

AI-Based Forecasting Model to improve load predictions.
Dynamic Power Procurement Optimization to efficiently manage power purchasing strategies.
AI-Based Forecasting Model
1. Data Collection
Data is collected from a variety of sources to enhance the model's predictive capability. Key sources include:

Weather Data: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
Historical Load Patterns: Past demand trends.
Public Holidays: Changes in demand during non-working days.
Urban Development: Impact of construction and new real estate projects.
Solar Power Generation Forecasts: Predictions on available solar power.
2. Model Development
Feature Engineering
The model will include features reflecting relationships between weather, time-of-day, and power demand. For instance:

Higher temperatures may lead to increased cooling needs, raising power consumption.
Solar generation data will help balance supply forecasts.
Algorithm Selection
We will use a combination of machine learning techniques to develop an accurate and reliable model:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks for time-series forecasting.
Ensemble Methods (e.g., Random Forest) to strengthen predictive robustness.
Training and Validation
The model will be trained on historical data, and recent data will be used to validate predictions. The goal is to ensure high accuracy and reliability for future demand predictions.

3. Compensation Methodology
Dynamic Load Shifting
AI-driven demand response strategies will be employed to shift or reduce loads during peak times, helping flatten demand curves.

Real-Time Adjustments
Real-time data will allow the model to dynamically adjust power procurement strategies, ensuring that generation and load are effectively balanced.

Optimization of Power Procurement
RTC vs. Slot-Wise Power
Round the Clock (RTC) Power: Secure RTC power during predictable low-demand periods at lower rates.
Slot-Wise Power: Purchase power for peak demand periods based on forecasted needs.
Long-Term Contracts
The model will help identify optimal time periods for negotiating long-term power purchase agreements, factoring in projected load growth and seasonal variations to ensure cost-effective and reliable supply.
