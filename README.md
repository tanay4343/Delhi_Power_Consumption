Proposed Solution: AI-Based Load Forecasting and Optimization for NCT of Delhi 
The National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi faces significant challenges in managing its highly 
variable power demand, influenced by seasonal fluctuations, time-of-day variations, and rapid urban 
development. To address these issues, we propose developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based 
load forecasting and optimization model. This model aims to enhance accuracy in power demand 
forecasting and optimize power procurement strategies. 
AI-Based Forecasting Model 
1. Data Collection: Integrate diverse data sources including weather conditions (temperature, 
humidity, wind speed), historical load patterns, public holidays, real estate development, and solar 
power generation forecasts. This comprehensive data set forms the foundation for accurate 
predictions. 
2. Model Development: - Feature Engineering: Develop features that reflect the relationships between weather, time-of
day, and power demand. For instance, high temperatures may correlate with increased cooling 
needs. - Algorithm Selection: Employ advanced machine learning techniques such as Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series forecasting and ensemble methods like Random Forests for 
robust predictions. - Training and Validation: Train the model with historical data and validate its accuracy with recent 
data to ensure reliable forecasting 
3. Compensation Methodology: - Dynamic Load Shifting: Implement demand response strategies to shift or reduce loads during 
peak times. Use AI forecasts to incentivize changes in consumption patterns. - Real-Time Adjustments: Use real-time data to adjust power procurement strategies dynamically, 
balancing load and generation effectively. 
Optimization of Power Procurement - RTC vs. Slot-Wise Power: The model will help balance the procurement of Round the Clock (RTC) 
power and slot-wise power. Secure RTC power during predictable low-demand periods at lower rates 
and rely on slot-wise power during peak periods. - Long-Term Contracts: Factor in load growth projections and seasonal variations to negotiate long
term power purchase agreements, ensuring a cost-effective and reliable supply.
